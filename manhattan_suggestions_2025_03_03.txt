1. don't dump all the json data into the attributes, serialize a json into data instead
   in `run_publish(message, attributes)` put it in the `message` variable
2. query database when checking for duplicates instead of storing seen messages in an array and only dupe checking messages seen in that session
3. add a way to set the message id in the publish ui (possibly add ways to set every attribute)
